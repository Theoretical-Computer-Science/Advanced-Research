## Abstract

We present **Granular Arithmetic Meta-Learning (GAML)** — a novel mathematical framework unifying granular computing, category-theoretic reasoning, adaptive meta-learning, and interdisciplinary node-level attention into a single coherent architecture for next-generation artificial intelligence. GAML transcends traditional deep learning by introducing *granular arithmetic spaces*, where computation is performed not on vectors or tensors, but on structured information granules governed by algebraic laws derived from lattice theory, measure theory, and type logic.

This work introduces:

- A formal system of **Granular Arithmetic (GA)** with operations over information granules.
- A new form of attention: **Interdisciplinary Cross-Synthesis Attention (ICSA)** that dynamically synthesizes knowledge across domains using categorical pullbacks and neural-symbolic fusion.
- An end-to-end **Automated Discovery Workflow (ADW)** integrating
