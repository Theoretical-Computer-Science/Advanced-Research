> **Unifying theoretical physics, formal mathematics, and advanced machine learning to build the next generation of coherent, transparent, and symbiotic intelligence.**

This repository serves as the core research hub for the **NeuralBlitz** framework. It explores the deep intersection between theoretical computer science and physical laws, aiming to move beyond "black box" AI toward a "glass box" model grounded in verifiable logic and mathematical modeling.

## 🧬 Research Overview

The research contained here focuses on creating a symbiotic intelligence framework that is **coherent by design**. Instead of relying solely on pattern association, we investigate how AI can utilize theorem proving and physical modeling to achieve radical transparency.

### Key Research Domains

*   **Theoretical Physics:** Applying principles of information theory, entropy, and quantum logic to neural architectures.
*   **Formal Mathematics:** Utilizing automated theorem proving and formal verification to ensure AI decision paths are logically sound.
*   **AI/ML Integration:** Bridging the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and structured mathematical reasoning.
*   **Mathematical Modeling:** Developing complex simulations to test the "Symbiotic Intelligence" hypothesis in dynamic environments.
*   **MLOps for Research:** Creating robust pipelines for iterative theoretical experimentation and model evaluation.
